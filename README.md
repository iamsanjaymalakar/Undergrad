### Assignment 5: xv6 Paging

An important feature lacking in xv6 is the ability to swap out pages to a backing store. That is, at each
moment in time, all processes are held within the physical memory. You have to implement a paging
framework for xv6, which can take out pages and storing them on a disk. Also, the framework will retrieve
pages back to the memory on demand. In your framework, each process is responsible for paging in and
out its own pages. To keep things simple, we will use the file system interface supplied and create for each
process a file in which swapped-out memory pages are stored.

### Project: DNS Cache Poisoning

DNS (Domain Name System) is the Internet's phonebook; it translates hostnames
to IP addresses and vice-versa. This is done via DNS resolution. DNS attacks
manipulate this resolution process in various ways. One of them is DNS Cache
Poisoning Attack. There are two main ways to perform this attack, local (where
the attacker and victim DNS server are on the same network, packet
sniffing is possible) and remote (where packet sniffing is not possible). I've
implemented the remote DNS cache poisoning attack.

__Lab Environment__

To demonstrate this attack, I have used three virtual machines, which runs on one
single physical machine.

1. A DNS server
2. Victim user
3. Attacker which also hosts fake DNS server

__Report__

More details about the attack [here](4-1/CSE406%20-%20Computer%20Security%20Sessional/DNS%20Cache%20Poisoning/report.pdf).

## Machine Learning

### Assignment 1: Decision Tree and AdaBoost for Classification

The decision tree is one of the models extensively used in classification problems. In ensemble learning, we combine decisions from multiple weak learners to solve a classification problem. This assignment implements a decision tree classifier and uses it within the AdaBoost algorithm.

- [Description](4-2/CSE%20471%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20Sessional/Assignment%201%20-%20Decision%20Tree%20and%20AdaBoost%20for%20Classification/Assignment%201.pdf)

### Assignment 2: Text Classification

Stack Exchange is a very popular Q&A (Question-and-Answer) based website. We want to analyze some archived data of Stack Exchange using text classification.  The link to the stack exchange archive is <https://archive.org/details/stackexchange>. The goal of text classification is to identify the topic for a piece of text (news article, web-blog, etc.).  Text classification has obvious utility in the age of information overload, and it has become very popular for applied machine learning algorithms. In this project, you will implement k-nearest neighbor and NaiveBayes, use these to text classification on Stack Exchange sample data, and compare the performances of these techniques.

### Assignment 3: Dimensionality  Reduction using Principal  Component Analysis and Clustering  using  Expectation-maximization  Algorithm
