Lots of other forms of the same theorem exist. The most useful, perhaps, are
expressed in trigonometric terms, as follows:
\begin{equation}
    sin^2\theta+cos^2\theta=1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    sec^2\theta-tan^2\theta=1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    cosec^2\theta+cot^2\theta=1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Representing the First}
Taking 1, we can show them as shown in Figure\ref{fig:fig2}. When we take a point at
unit distance from the origin, the $y$ and $x$ co-ordinates become sin$\theta$ and cos$\theta$
respectively. Therefore, sum of the squares of the two becomes equal to the
square of the unit distance, which of course, is 1.
