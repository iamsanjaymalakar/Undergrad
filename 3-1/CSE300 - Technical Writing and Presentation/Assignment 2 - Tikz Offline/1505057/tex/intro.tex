In this document, we present the very famous theorem in mathematics: \textit{Pythagorean
theorem}, which is stated as follows.
\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
The square of the hypotenuse (the
side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two
sides.
\end{theorem}

~~~Numerous mathematicians proposed various proofs to the theorem. The
theorem was long known even before the time of Pythagoras. Pythagoras was
the first to provide with a sound proof. The proof that Pythagoras gave was
by \textit{rearrangement}. Even the great Albert Einstein also proved the theorem
without rearrangement, rather by using dissection. Figure 1 shows the visual
representation of the theorem.
