Project (Term assignment) submission for section A
Folder structure of your project
Let the root folder of your project is called ProjectRoot. All the source code of your project is inside this folder, or inside some package within this folder.

If your project uses images or any other binary content, all such content should be stored in a subfolder called BinaryContent. (If you want you can have further subfolders inside this folder).

If your project uses any text files (e.g. configurations, pre-loaded data from a text file, javaFX markup files (fxml), style sheet etc.), all such files should be stored in a subfolder called TextContent. (If you want you can have further subfolders inside this folder)

After compiling your source code, we will put all the class files inside the ProjectRoot folder within appropriate package subfolder structure. We will run your project from the ProjectRoot folder using command line. So, the folders BinaryContent and TextContent will be available in the current working directory. As such, when you load any files, you should appropriately use relative path.

You must write your codes in such a way to abide by these requirements and store the necessary binary and text contents in the appropriate locations as mentioned above.
