## Assignment 1: Decision Tree and AdaBoost for Classification

Decision  tree  is  one  of  the  models  extensively  used  in  classification  problems.  In  ensemble learning, we combine decisions from multiple weak learners to solve a classification problem. This assignment implements a decision tree classifier and uses it within AdaBoost algorithm.

## Assignment 2: Text Classification

Stack Exchange is a very popular Q&A (Question-and-Answer) based website. We want to analyze some archived data of Stack Exchange using text classification.  The link to stack exchange archive is <https://archive.org/details/stackexchange>. The goal of text classification is to identify the topic for a piece of text (newsarticle, web-blog, etc.).  Text classification has obvious utility in the age of infor-mation overload, and it has become very popular for applied machine learningalgorithms.  In this project, you will implement k-nearest neighbor and NaiveBayes,  apply these to text classification on Stack Exchange sample data, and compare the performances of these techniques.
